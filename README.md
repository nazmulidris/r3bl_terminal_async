# This crate has been permanently moved to [r3bl_terminal_async](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/tree/main/terminal_async).

The `r3bl_terminal_async` library lets your CLI program be asynchronous and
interactive without blocking the main thread. Your spawned tasks can use it to
concurrently write to the display output, pause and resume it. You can also display of
colorful animated spinners âŒ›ðŸŒˆ for long running tasks. With it, you can create
beautiful, powerful, and interactive REPLs (read execute print loops) with ease.
